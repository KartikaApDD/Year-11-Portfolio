    <h1>TURN AROUND</h1>
    <img src="turnaround.jpg">

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I am making a character, turn around sketch to showing how my character suposed to look like when I will make the animation
    I change some of the things that I need to change in my turn around sheet.
</p>
<img src="turnaround.jpg">

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I kinda like the proportions of the body of my turn around but I kinda don't like the hands of my character
    because it does not show my character like females character. It looks more like a masculin woman, what I planned is make my sketch of the design
    would looks like a normal tall woman. 
</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>Do you think my turn around character looks good?</h4>
<p>Person 1: She thinks that my turn around character looks fine and does not have anything that looks not good
    but she said that the hair of my design kinda not fit and she thinks I need to remove the hair because it does not fit with the design I make.
</p>
<h4>What do you think that I need to improve on this design?</h4>
<p>Person 1: She said that I do not need something that I need change, just do not add the </p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I just changing the hand a bit, but it looks the same like the first design of the turn around.</p>

<h1>TORSO AND BODY</h1>

<h3>Development</h3>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I have changing the look of the character because the design does not look like
    a woman first and the hand is looking kinda weird too. That is why at first I make the design
    I change a bit of it.
</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>What do you think about my design?</h4>
<p>Person 1: "Kinda, because there is still something that you need to change. It looks
    kinda scary too."</p>

<h4>What do you think that I need to improve on this design?</h4>
<p>Person 1: "Just change some the part of the body."</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I am making a bit changes of my design, I am trying make the design more looking
    like what I want to make at first (what I have planned). Adjust something, and more.
</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I tried to change it and compare it with my sketch. Change a bit the part of the arm.</p>

<p>Person 1: "The arm is looking weird, becaause it is not look like a woman arms."</p>

<h4>What do you think that I need to improve on this design?</h4>
<p>Person 1: "Try to change the part of the arm as best as you can. Take a look of your sketch and try to compare and change at the same time
    to make sure your arm will look like what you expect."</p>


<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I am always make a changes of the arms to looks really like what I have drawn on my sketch but 
    it still looking not right. The arm is not like a human arm because it is so big but I am always
    change the look of the arm as best as I can to look like what I have drawn on the sketch.
