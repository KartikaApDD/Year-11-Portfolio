<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>Do you think the function working really well, do you can understand the short instruction that the game has given?</h4>
<p>Person 1: Yes</p>
<p>Person 2: Yes the function working well but i think when it come to the instruction you need to the point. That would be great</p>

<h4>Do you have a feedback of the greet/introduction of the game?</h4>
<p>Person 1: I think that would be good if I don't need to put any name</p>
<p>Person 2: Can you change when we need to put our name and change it to be anonym?</p>

<h4>Do you have any other feedback that you want to tell?</h4>
<p>"Just that, honestly"</p>
<p>"No"</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I remove the part when player need to put their name to anonym (player)</p>
<img src="develpment needs/introo.png">
<p>Also I change the instruction to be more clear that would help the player more understand how the game works</p>

<h3>Final Feedback</h3>
<p>"No, i think this already good because this is what I really expected!"</p>
<p>"No"</p>

<h1>2. STORYLINE</h1>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I start the story line by make up the story really well that would make the player thinks that the story is enough to be understand by them</p>
<img src="develpment needs/bgstory.png">
<p>Finally I adding the code that would send the player to the main room to start the game</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>What do you think about the story line? Do you understand it easily?</h4>
<p>Person 1: No, kinda hard to understand because you tell too much and did not hit the main point.</p>
<p>Person 2: No, there is no need to tell too much. I think you need to change it and just tell the point of the story more detail because the story that you give 
  is not that detail. Hope this feedback help!
</p>

<h4>Do you have any feedback about this part (storyline)?</h4>
<p>Person 1: No</p>
<p>Person 2: Maybe I would say that you need to give some option in this part, like we can choose between we want to read the story line or just skip it and start the game
  because sometimes some people do not want to read a lot, right?
</p>

<h4>Do you have any other feedback that you want to tell?</h4>
<p>"Nope"</p>
<p>"Just those"</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I am starting by improving the storyline first, trying to make it more better and not boring as possible. Make the story more interesting.</p>
<img src="develpment needs/developstory.png">
<p>Then I adding option for player if they wish to read the story or they want to skip it, but basically I will make the player can not skip the story because it is the main point of the game. </p>
