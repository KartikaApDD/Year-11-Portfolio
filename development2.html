<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>Do you think the function working really well, do you can understand the short instruction that the game has given?</h4>
<p>Person 1: Yes</p>
<p>Person 2: Yes the function working well but i think when it come to the instruction you need to the point. That would be great</p>

<h4>Do you have a feedback of the greet/introduction of the game?</h4>
<p>Person 1: I think that would be good if I don't need to put any name</p>
<p>Person 2: Can you change when we need to put our name and change it to be anonym?</p>

<h4>Do you have any other feedback that you want to tell?</h4>
<p>"Just that, honestly"</p>
<p>"No"</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I remove the part when player need to put their name to anonym (player)</p>
<img src="develpment needs/introo.png">
<p>Also I change the instruction to be more clear that would help the player more understand how the game works</p>
