          <div class="col">
            <p1>Implications is an occasion when you seem to suggest something without saying it directly.
              It's relevant because for make the design looks good in the final, the movement would look smooth, 
              it can be easy to use like the movements that I planned is working.

          <h4>Aesthetics</h4>
          <p2>Aesthetic is used to talk about beauty or art, and people's appreciation of beautiful things.
            It's relevant because how I would planning my design would look good based from the colour, the accessories
            that I planned to put it on the design and I would make sure that my design is looking soft and pretty like I
            planned to make it looking great as possible.
          </p2>
          <h4>Functionality</h4>
          <p2>Functionality is the quality or state of being functional. 
            It's relevant because I would use it for planning does my design would be functional
            to be used for the users that would use it in the future, I would do that by make sure that I have plan 
            for what it use for and adjust it by for what it is use for. So that is my design can be use for something, and I am not forget to make sure
            that my design working when it would be use.
          </p2>
          <h4>Usability</h4>
          <p2> Usability is how the ease of use and overall user experience.
            It's relevant because I want to make the design would be easy to use for the users, 
            the main thing is I would like to make my design would looking smooth 
            when it moves and making sure that
            the movement are working when it would be planning to try use it to the target or the users.
          </p2>
          <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>

            such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, 
            names and images used in commerce. I would make sure that the design that I will make
            is not copy from someone's design or use my own design. I will do it by making sure that I make 
            my own design or this project but if I am using the other's person design I would make
            sure that I have giveen a credit and asking permission from the artist. Something that I would not do is
