<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I kinda like the proportions of the body of my turn around but I kinda don't like the hands of my character
    because it does not show my character like females character. It looks more like a masculin woman, what I planned is make my sketch of the design
    would looks like a normal tall woman.
