<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I think my turn around character needs some improvements like the improvement on the design. I think I need to change the 
proportions of the body. The hands look kinda weird because I think it is does not like what I want to make.
What I want to make is tall females and the design does not look like that, that's why I decided that 
I want to change it.
